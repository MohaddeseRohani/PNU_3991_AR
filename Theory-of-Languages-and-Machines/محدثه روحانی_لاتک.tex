For the state A, the incoming edges to this state are from $B_\{0\}$ to C with label $b/0$ and $B_\{1\}$ to C with label $b/0$. There is no difference in the outputs of the incoming edges to this state, and so in the constructing Moore machine the output for this state will be 0.\\

For the state D, the incoming edges are A to D with label b/0, from C to D with label a/0, and from D to D with label b/1.\\
We get two different outputs for two incoming edges (D to D output 1, C to D output 0). So, the state D will be divided into two, namely, $D_\{0\}$ and $D_\{1\}$. The outgoing edges are duplicated for both the states generated from D. The modiﬁ ed machine is

21.Convert the following Mealy machine into an equivalent Moore machine. [UPTU 2004]\\
Solution: The state $q_0$ has two incoming edges: from $q_1$ with label a/0 and from $q_3$ with label $b/1$. As there is a difference in output, the state $q_0$ is divided into $q_00$ and $q_01$ with outputs 0 and 1, respectively. The states $q_1$ and $q_3$ have only one incoming edge each, and so there is no need of division. The state $q_2$ has three incoming edges; among those, two are of output '0' and another is of output '1'. Thus, it is divided into $q_20$ and $q_21$ with outputs 0 and 1, respectively.

From $q_1$ input with label 'a' ends on $q_00$, and from $q_3$ input with label 'b' ends on $q_01$. The outputs from old $q_1$ state are duplicated from $q_00$ and $q_01$.\\
The state $q_1$ and $q_3$ are not divided. $q_1$ gets output '1' and $q_3$ gets output '0'.
Dividing the state $q_0$ and placing $q_1$ and $q_3$, the intermediate machine becomes as follows\\

The state $q_24$ is divided into $q_20$ and $q_21$. From $q_00$ and $q_01$ input with label 'a' ends on $q_21$. From $q_3$ input with label 'a' ends on $q_20$. There is a loop on $q_2$. That loop will be on $q_20$ with label 'b'. Another transition with label 'b' is drawn from $q_21$ to $q_20$. The final Moore machine is as follows\\

22.Minimize the following finite automata.\\
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{rccc}

	\hline
	$\rightarrow$&A&B&F\\
	&B&A&F\\
	&C&G&A\\
	&D&H&B\\

Here F, G, and H are the final states.\\
Solution: In the finite automata, the states are $\{A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H\}$. Name this set as $S_0$.\\
$S_0: \{A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H\}$\\


All of the states are 0 equivalents.\\
In the finite automata, there are two types of states: final state and non-final states. So, divide the set of states into two parts, Q1 and Q2.\\
$Q_1 = \{F, G, H\} Q_2 = \{A, B, C, D, E\}$\\
$S_1: \{\{F, G, H\} \{A, B, C, D, E\}\}$\\
The states belonging to same subset are 1-equivalent because they are in the same set for string length 1. The states belonging to different subsets are 1-distinguishable.\\
The next states of F are H and C. The next states of G and H are A, D and A, C, respectively.\\
A, D and A, C belong to the same subset but H and C belong to a different subset. So, F, G, and H are divided into $\{F\}, \{G, H\}$.\\

For input 0, the next states of A, B, C, D, and E are B, A, G, H, and A, respectively. For input 1,the next states of A, B, C, D, and E are F, F, A, B, and G, respectively. So, the set $\{A, B, C, D, E\}$ is divided into $\{A, B, E\}$ and $\{C, D\}$.\\
             $S_2: \{\{F\} \{G, H\} \{A, B, E\} \{C, D\}\}$\\
By the same process, $\{A, B, E\}$ is divided into $\{A, B\}$, $\{E\}$.\\
$S_3: \{\{F\} \{G, H\} \{A, B\} \{E\} \{C, D\}\} = \{\{A, B\}, \{C, D\}, \{E\}, \{F\}, \{G, H\}\}$\\

The set is not dividable further. So, these are the states of minimized DFA. Let us rename the subsets as $q_0, q_1, q_2, q_3$, and $q_4$. The initial state was A, and so here the initial state is $\{A, B\}, i.e., q_0$. The ﬁnal state was F, G, and H, and so here the ﬁ nal states are $\{F\}, i.e., q_3$ and $\{G, H\}, i.e., q_4$. The tabular representation of minimized $DFA$ is
